# ‚úàÔ∏è Sentiment Analysis on US Airline Reviews üí¨

## ‚ú® Project Overview

This project focuses on building a **deep learning model** to analyze the sentiment of tweets related to US airlines. By leveraging customer reviews, we aim to classify tweets as either **positive** or **negative**, providing insights into public perception of various airlines. This can be invaluable for airlines to understand customer satisfaction and address pain points.

---

## üìä Dataset

The dataset used is `Tweets.csv`, which contains a collection of tweets about various US airlines. The key columns utilized for this analysis are:

* `text`: The actual tweet content.
* `airline_sentiment`: The sentiment of the tweet (positive, neutral, or negative).

For this specific analysis, **neutral** sentiment tweets are filtered out to focus solely on distinguishing between positive and negative feedback.

---

## üöÄ Features

* **Data Loading & Exploration**: Reads the tweet data and provides initial insights into its structure and relevant columns.
* **Sentiment Filtering**: Filters out 'neutral' tweets to create a more focused binary classification problem (positive vs. negative).
* **Text Preprocessing**:
    * **Tokenization**: Converts raw text into sequences of integers, representing words.
    * **Padding**: Ensures all input sequences have the same length for consistent model input.
* **Deep Learning Model (LSTM)**:
    * Utilizes a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** neural network, well-suited for sequential data like text.
    * Incorporates an **Embedding Layer** to efficiently represent words in a dense vector space.
    * Includes **SpatialDropout1D** and **Dropout** layers for regularization to prevent overfitting.
    * Employs **Dense** layers for classification.
* **Model Training**: Trains the LSTM model to learn patterns and classify sentiment based on the processed tweet data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

* **Python** üêç
* **Libraries**:
    * `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    * `matplotlib`: For potential data visualization (though not explicitly used for plotting in the provided snippet, it's a common library for this).
    * `tensorflow.keras`: For building and training the deep learning model.
        * `Tokenizer`: For text tokenization.
        * `pad_sequences`: For padding sequences.
        * `Sequential`: For defining the neural network model.
        * `LSTM`, `Dense`, `Dropout`, `SpatialDropout1D`, `Embedding`: For defining the layers of the LSTM model.

## üß† Model Architecture (LSTM)

The core of this project is an LSTM model designed for sentiment classification. The general architecture involves:

1.  **Embedding Layer**: Maps each word to a dense vector, capturing semantic relationships.
    * `input_dim`: `vocab_size` (total unique words + 1)
    * `output_dim`: 100 (embedding dimension)
    * `input_length`: `maxlen` (200, the fixed length of input sequences)
2.  **SpatialDropout1D**: A dropout variant that drops entire 1D feature maps, effective for text data.
3.  **LSTM Layer**: The recurrent layer capable of learning long-term dependencies in text.
    * `units`: 100
    * `dropout`: 0.2
    * `recurrent_dropout`: 0.2
4.  **Dense Layer**: A fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
    * `units`: 100
    * `activation`: 'relu'
5.  **Output Dense Layer**: A single output neuron with sigmoid activation for binary classification (positive/negative).
    * `units`: 1
    * `activation`: 'sigmoid'

The model is compiled with the `adam` optimizer and `binary_crossentropy` loss, suitable for binary classification tasks.
